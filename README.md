# 🖐️ Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Sign Language Detection system** using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**.  
A CNN model is trained to recognize hand gestures used in sign language from image data.

## 🔍 Methodology

- Collected hand gesture image data
- Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization)
- Built a CNN model using convolution and pooling layers
- Trained the model on labeled gesture data
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics
